# MadeToStick Title Generator - Amazon Compliance Update

## What Changed (Based on Official Amazon Guidelines)

### ✅ FIXED: Critical Violations

1. **Brand Now Always First**
   - OLD: "Latinx Singers Stickers Waterproof Vinyl for General/Multi-use | MadeToStick Brand 5 Pack 3x4"
   - NEW: "MadeToStick Latinx Singers Vinyl Stickers Waterproof 3x4" 5-Pack for General/Multi-use"
   - Why: Amazon requires brand first in recommended title order

2. **Removed Pipe Character (|)**
   - Pipe is NOT in Amazon's allowed special characters list
   - Only allowed: hyphens (-), slashes (/), commas (,), ampersands (&), periods (.)

3. **Removed "Premium" Language**
   - Amazon prohibits subjective commentary like "Premium", "Best", "Hot Item"
   - Removed "Brand Positioning" toggle entirely

4. **Removed "Brand" Word**
   - "MadeToStick Brand" is redundant and wastes characters
   - Now just "MadeToStick"

5. **Target 80 Characters (Not 200)**
   - Amazon RECOMMENDS 80 chars max for mobile visibility
   - 200 is the hard limit, but most get truncated on mobile
   - Mobile preview now shows first 80 chars (changed from 150)

### ✅ NEW: Compliance Checker

Titles are now scored on:
- ✓ Brand first (mandatory)
- ✓ Under 80 characters (recommended)
- ✓ No prohibited special characters
- ✓ No word repetition (same word max 2x)
- ✓ Waterproof mentioned (bonus)
- ✓ Product type in first 50 chars (bonus)

**Score Badges:**
- 90-100% = "✓ Amazon Compliant" (green)
- 70-89% = "Score: XX%" (yellow - minor issues)
- 0-69% = "Score: XX%" (orange - violations present)

**Violations Display:**
If a title violates guidelines, you'll see warnings like:
- "⚠️ Brand not first"
- "⚠️ 95 chars (80+ truncates on mobile)"
- "⚠️ Prohibited special character"
- "⚠️ Word repetition: stickers"

### ✅ UPDATED: Title Generation Strategy

**Amazon's Official Order:**
Brand → Design/Style → Material → Product Type → Key Attribute → Color → Size → Pack Count → Use Case

**6 Compliant Strategies Generated:**
1. Full compliant (all attributes in order)
2. Compact (omits standard vinyl, includes others)
3. Material emphasis (for holographic/puffy/clear)
4. Pack emphasis (for bulk value positioning)
5. Waterproof emphasis (key benefit)
6. Use case specific (when important)

All strategies maintain brand-first compliance.

### ✅ UPDATED: Tips Section

Changed from generic SEO advice to Amazon's official requirements:
- 80 character recommendation
- Brand-first requirement
- Violation warnings
- What triggers suppression

---

## Why This Matters

### Before (Non-Compliant):
- Titles could be auto-corrected by Amazon
- Listings could be suppressed from search
- Brand buried = less trust
- Over 80 chars = mobile truncation

### After (Compliant):
- ✓ Passes Amazon's automated checks
- ✓ Won't be suppressed or auto-corrected
- ✓ Brand visibility maximized
- ✓ Mobile-optimized by default
